// tools/ds4/ds4_moe.hpp - the DeepSeek-V4 routed-expert TIER as a reusable library (slice ds4-moe).
//
// WHAT THIS IS.  `tools/ds4/moe_replay.cpp` proved the expert half of a DeepSeek-V4 decode on this machine
// (FINDINGS s10-s12): a VRAM cache of 6.75 MiB expert slots seeded from a routing profile, the CPU ExpertPool on
// the misses, a PCIe share of the misses computed on the GPU in parallel, a pinned host arena holding every
// expert, and predicted expert prefetch on a second stream under the dense work - measured 20.57 tok/s at 2150
// slots, pf-b 1.43, pcie 0.25 dithered.  That file is a HARNESS: it drives the pieces itself, per token, with a
// synthetic stand-in for the dense half and recorded routes instead of a router.
//
// `Ds4MoeTier` is the same machinery as one object, used once per layer by the real engine:
//
//     tier.init(gguf, cfg, err);                     // once, at startup
//     tier.seed_from_routes(routes_bin, err);        // the static profile, once
//     for each layer l of each token:
//         tier.prefetch(l, top16);                   // right after predict(l), before attention(l)
//         tier.run(l, ids6, w6, x, out);             // after router(l); out = sum_k w_k * expert_k(x)
//
// `run` is synchronous: the engine calls it per layer and needs `out` before the next one.  `prefetch` is not:
// it issues its DMAs on a second stream and returns immediately, so they overlap the dense work the caller is
// about to do between `prefetch` and `run`.
//
// TWO MODES.  `cfg.cpu_only` runs the whole expert half on the CPU pool: no ExpertCache, no PCIe share, no CUDA
// call of any kind, so the tier can be linked into a binary that must never touch the driver (this slice's gate,
// and machines without a GPU).  Otherwise the three tiers of the plan run concurrently and the weighted sum is
// assembled from all of them.
//
// THE INVARIANT, and the one thing to read before changing anything here:
//
//     for any (layer, ids, weights, x), run()'s output equals the weighted sum of the dequantised experts
//     computed in F32 - the only permitted difference being the expert kernels' own 8-bit activation rounding.
//
// It is tested by `tools/ds4/test_ds4_moe.cpp` against a dequant+F32 reference (weights through ggml's
// `to_float`), CPU-only, at rel < 1e-3 per layer and per expert.
//
// THE SWIGLU CLAMP.  DeepSeek-V4's graph clamps the expert pre-activations before the SwiGLU - gate -> min(gate, L),
// up -> clamp(up, -L, L), L = `swiglu_clamp_exp` = 10.0 (`tools/ds4/ds4_ref.cpp`, mirroring llama.cpp's DEEPSEEK4
// branch).  The native expert kernels apply it through `NativeFmt::swiglu_limit` (CPU: `native_gu_rows` and the
// AVX2/AVX-512 multi-token kernels) and `NativeExpertLayout::swiglu_limit` (CUDA: the grouped kernels' SwiGLU
// passes); `ds4_moe_geom_from_gguf` reads L into `Ds4MoeGeom::swiglu_limit` and the tier passes it to both.  Every
// other model leaves the limit at +inf, which is the unclamped arithmetic bit for bit.  On real activations L
// binds rarely (FINDINGS s13), so `test_ds4_moe` also reruns its real arms with L forced to 1.0 to check the path.
